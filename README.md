# Cursor JS

**Cursor.js** is a JavaScript library that allows you to create and customize cursors with various templates and properties. You can apply these custom cursors to any `div` or `section` element on your webpage, with support for dynamic effects and state-based text content. The Cursors can be easily be created using either HTML **data attributes** or JavaScript **Cursor** object. You can see all the cursor effects and templates *here*.

## How to Use?
You can either download the JavaScript File, place it in the project and use __script tag__ with the JavaScript file as source. Or you can use the cdn link provided.

### 1. Using Script Tag

`<script type="module" src="./src/main.js"></script>`

If you decide to use this method, please make sure you have `type="module"` enabled.
